## What is this?

This project is a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that you can use in
your editor to inspect and change markdown files.
This extension is built around remark, which is a very popular ecosystem of
plugins that work with markdown.
You can choose from the 150+ plugins that already exist or make your own.

See [remark][] for info on what the remark ecosystem is.

## When should I use this?

You can use this extension if you want to check (lint) and format markdown
files from within your editor.

To configure this extension, you define your preferred markdown style in a
configuration file (`.remarkrc`, `.remarkrc.js`, etc. or in `package.json`).
This file is picked up by `vscode-remark` and other tools (useful for
contributors that donâ€™t use VS Code).

The configuration file is also used by [`remark-cli`][remark-cli], which is
recommended to be used alongside `vscode-remark`, as an npm script and/or in
CI, to enforce the markdown style.

## Use

This example enables VS Code users that have this extension installed to see
warnings about markdown style in their editor and the `Problems` pane and to
format markdown from a command.

Make sure that this extension is installed and then install the CLI and
plugins:

```sh
npm install remark-cli remark-preset-lint-recommended remark-preset-lint-consistent remark-toc
```

Then, add a `remarkConfig` to your `package.json` to configure remark:

```js
  /* â€¦ */
  "remarkConfig": {
    "settings": {
      "bullet": "*", // Use `*` for list item bullets (default)
      // See <https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark-stringify> for more options.
    },
    "plugins": [
      "remark-preset-lint-consistent", // Check that markdown is consistent.
      "remark-preset-lint-recommended", // Few recommended rules.
      [
        // Generate a table of contents in `## Contents`
        "remark-toc",
        {
          "heading": "contents"
        }
      ]
    ]
  },
  /* â€¦ */
```

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: you must remove the comments in the above examples when
> copy/pasting them, as comments are not supported in `package.json` files.

Now, you can open markdown files in your project, and youâ€™ll see squiggly lines
and warnings in the `Problems` pane.
Hereâ€™s an example that should produce problems you can use to verify:

```markdown
1) Hello, _Jupiter_ and *Neptune*!
```

### Formatting

This extension can format markdown files.

To format a file, first press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>.
Search for and select `Format Document Withâ€¦`.
Now select `remark`.

To make `vscode-remark` the default formatter for markdown, add the following to
your `settings.json` (which you can open with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>):

```json
{
  "[markdown]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "unifiedjs.vscode-remark",
  }
}
```

Optionally enable format on save:

```json
{
  "[markdown]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "unifiedjs.vscode-remark",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  }
}
```

## Plugins

The **remark** ecosystem has a variety of plugins available.
Most notably youâ€™ll want to check out [`remark-lint`][remark-lint].
See this curated [list of plugins][list-of-plugins] for more remark plugins.

## Syntax

remark follows CommonMark, which standardizes the differences between markdown
implementations, by default.
Some syntax extensions are supported through plugins.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

This plugin loads configuration files, plugins, and presets from your workspace.
Only use this plugin in workspaces you trust.
